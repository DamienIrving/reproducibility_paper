\section*{Box 1: The average scientist}

For the sake of argument, I have attempted to define the average research scientist working in the weather/climate sciences. The characterisation is based on the few documented surveys of how computational scientists do their work \citep{Hannay2009,Stodden2010} and is supplemented by my own personal experiences and conversations teaching computational best practices at various Software Carpentry workshops over the past few years while also working/studying in the weather and climate sciences.
