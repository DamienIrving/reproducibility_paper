\section*{Box 1: The average scientist}

For the sake of argument, I have attempted to define the average research scientist working in the weather/climate sciences. The characterisation is based on the few documented surveys of how computational scientists do their work \citep{Hannay2009,Stodden2010} and is supplemented by my own personal experiences and conversations teaching computational best practices at numerous Software Carpentry workshops while also working/studying in the weather and climate sciences. This average scientist:
\begin{itemize}
\item Aquired the knowledge to develop and use scientific software primarily from peers and through self-study, as opposed to formal education and training
\item Relies primarily on software like Python, MATLAB, IDL, NCL or R which has a large user/support base and is relatively simple to install on a Windows, Mac or Linux computer
\item Does most of their work on a desktop or intermediate computer (as opposed to a supercomputer)
\item Works on their own or in a very small team (i.e. 2-3 other scientists) and do all their software development themselves (i.e. they have no access to professional developers for assistance) 
\end{itemize}
