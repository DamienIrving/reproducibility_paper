\section{A possible solution}

An example of what such a baseline standard could look like was recently published in the Journal of Climate \citep{Irving2015}. It comprises three main components: a short computation section within the paper, an externally hosted snapshot of the associated code repository and the provision of supplementary log files that capture the data processing steps taken in producing each key result. 

\subsection{Computation section}





My solution requires skills that can be picked up in a two-day workshop \citep{Wilson2014,Wilson2014a}.

Won't fit everyone's need, but will fit most.
