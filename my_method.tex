\section{A possible solution}

An example of what a baseline standard for the communication of computational results in the weather and climate sciences might look like was recently published in the \textit{Journal of Climate} \citep{Irving2015}. It comprises three main components: a short computation section within the paper, an externally hosted snapshot of the associated code repository and the provision of supplementary log files that capture the data processing steps taken in producing each key result.
