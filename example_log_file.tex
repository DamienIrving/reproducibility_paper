\textbf{Box 3: Example log file}

FIXME: This should be a relatively simple example, like the log file associated with plotting the geopotential height zonal anomaly for a given timestep (i.e. a mix of cdo and python scripts, culminating with plot_map.py)

It should also give a brief not on how this was achieved. (i.e. Python scripts that act like cdo commands and stitched together with makefiles)
