\subsection{Rationale}

In devising a framework that might be adopted as a minimum standard, it was important to first consider why computational scientists do not currently publish their code. The literature on this topic is fairly sparse, however in a survey of the machine learning community \citet{Stodden2010} found that the top reason for not sharing code was the perceived time required to prepare it for publication, followed by the prospect of dealing with questions from users. Most respondents were sympathetic to the ideals of open science and reproducible research, but the practicalities seemed too difficult and time consuming, particularly when the pressure to publish is so strong and unrelenting.

The bewildering array of suggested tools and best practices is one reason why an individual working in the weather and climate sciences might place reproducibility in the `too hard' basket. An appropriate solution for any given scientist no doubt exists within that collection of tools and practices, but it is heavily obscured. Consider the regular scientist described in Box 1. In consulting the literature on reproducible computational research, they would be confronted with options including data provenance tracking systems like VisTrails \citep{Freire2012} and PyRDM \citep{Jacobs2014}, software environment managers like Docker and Vagrant \citep{Stodden2014}, and even online services where your code and data can be run by others \citep{Stodden2012}. These might be fantastic options for small teams of software engineers or experienced scientific programmers who may be dealing with very large workflows (e.g. post-processing of thousands of CMIP5 model runs), complex model simulations (e.g. coupled climate models) and/or production style code (e.g. they might be developing a satellite retrieval algorithm that has high re-use potential in the wider community), but a regular scientist has neither the requisite computational experience or a research problem of sufficient scale and complexity to necessarily require and/or make use of such tools.

The framework employed by \citet{Irving2016} was designed with this regular scientist in mind. It seeks to minimize both the time involved and the complexity of the associated tools, while at the same time remaining faithful to established best practices in scientific computing.
