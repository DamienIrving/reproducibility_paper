\section{Proposed guidelines}\label{s:guidelines}

To assist in the establishment a minimum standard for the communication of computational results, it is proposed that the following could be inserted into the author and reviewer guidelines of journals in the weather and climate sciences. The language used borrows in places from the guidelines recently adopted by \textit{Nature} \citep{Nature2014}.

\subsection{Author guidelines}

If computer code is central to any of the paper's major conclusions, then the following is required as a minimum standard: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A statement describing whether that code is available (e.g. via an online repository like GitHub or Bitbucket) and setting out any restrictions on accessibility.
\item A section within the paper that provides (i) a high-level description of the software used to execute that code (including citations for any academic papers written to describe that software), and (ii) details regarding the precise version of the software used listed in the following format: name, version number, release date, institution and DOI or URL.
\item A log file for each major result (including key figures) showing the computational steps
\item 
\end{enumerate}

Any practical issues preventing code sharing will be evaluated by the editors, who reserve the right to decline a paper if important code is unavailable.
