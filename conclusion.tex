\section{Conclusion}

In order to combat the reproducibility crisis in published computational research, a simple procedure for communicating computational results has been demonstrated \citep{Irving2015} and its rationale discussed. The procedure involves three key additions to traditional scientific papers: (1) a short computation section within the paper, (2) the availability of a (preferably version controlled and publicly accessible) code repository and (3) the provision of supplementary log files that capture the data processing steps taken in producing each key result. Importantly, the procedure does not substantially increase the workload of the author, reviewers or publisher. It should provide a starting point for weather and climate scientists (and perhaps computational scientists more generally) looking to publish reproducible research, and could be adopted as a minimum standard by relevant academic journals.
